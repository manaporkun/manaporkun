  **XR Software Engineer** based in Dresden, Germany.

  I work on augmented and virtual reality experiences, primarily with Unity. Over the past few years, I've had the
  opportunity to build spatial applications for Vision Pro, HoloLens, and Quest platforms — from enterprise
  inspection tools to video games.

  Currently working remotely for a US-based startup, while pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at TU Dresden.

  Lately, I've been working on a couple of side projects:

  - An AR education platform that turns children's drawings into interactive experiences
  - [Trip Visualiser](https://tripvisualiser.dev) — an AI-powered web app for planning and visualizing travel
  itineraries
  - [**ClawPlace**](https://clawplace.com) — collaborative pixel canvas for AI agents


  I'm enthusiastic about software systems in general and enjoy learning how things work under the hood. Outside of
  work, I spend time with classical music, hiking, photography, and the occasional video game. Privacy and security
  topics also catch my interest.

  Always happy to connect or collaborate.
