### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate software engineer with expertise in Unity and a strong interest in privacy, security, XR, science, technology, astronomy, and video games.

Over the years, I've had the privilege of working in dynamic environments where I've improved my problem-solving, communication, and collaboration skills. I'm committed to delivering high-quality work and take pride in making meaningful contributions to the teams I work with.

I'm always eager to take on new challenges and learn something new, whether it's developing engaging AR/VR experiences, video games or working on complex software projects. As someone who is constantly striving to improve, I see every opportunity as a chance to grow both personally and professionally.
