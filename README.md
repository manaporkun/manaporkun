### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer working primarily with Unity. My interests include privacy, security, XR, science, and video games. I've been fortunate to work in various environments, each teaching me valuable lessons in problem-solving, communication, and teamwork.

I'm always eager to learn and contribute, whether it's in AR/VR, game development, or other software projects. If you'd like to connect or collaborate, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn or check out my YouTube channel.
